//======================================================================
// Notes:
//  - For light/dark theme: This website always sets data-theme="..."
//    so don't need: @media only screen and (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {...}
//  - For CSS variables, the last setting is used. So, overrides of PicoCSS
//    variables must com after including PicoCSS.
