Hello again, World, are you still out there?

<!--more-->

Well, this blog is certainly off to an <u>un</u>amazing start.
My {{< page-link page_id="hello-world" text="first blog post" >}} was six months ago.
This, my second blog post, is six months later.
So, zilch for six whole months!

I do have excuses. Good ones, too, I think.

What happened? Well, almost the day after I first posted I came down with a cold, flu, maybe even COVID (I didn't get tested) that was nasty at first then lingered for an entire month.
Once my energy levels were back I spent a month catching up on other things that needed doing.
Then after that month of catch-up, I came down with yet another cold, flu, maybe even COVID that again lingered for an entire month.
And again needed a month of catch-up.

That explains 4 of the 6 months.
I'm still working on the excuses for the last 2 months.
I'll report back to you with them as soon as they're ready.

I needed to decide to either kill off or resurrect this blog.

I decided to resurrect.

I have several drafts that are "almost complete" that I'll post soon.
Being "almost complete" means "not yet perfect" which is a demon I am fighting (a main reason why I'm writing this blog).
Once it's "good enough", I need to post it asap and move on.

So, World, hello again: please stay tuned (really).
